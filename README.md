# Weather + ML Prediction API

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a **FastAPI API** that combines **real-time weather data** with a **local machine learning model** to make predictions. For example, it can recommend clothing based on the temperature or classify weather-related risk levels.

This project showcases:

- Integration of **local ML models** with external APIs
- **Token-based authentication** for secure API access
- **Logging**, environment variables, and error handling — often skipped by beginners
- Clear **JSON response structure**, suitable for frontend integration

## Use Cases

- Personal assistants: Suggest clothing or outdoor activities  
- IoT projects: Feed weather data to smart devices and make ML predictions  
- Portfolio / learning: Demonstrates API + ML integration, security, and clean design
